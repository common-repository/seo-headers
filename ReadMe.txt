SEO Headers allows you to change the headline without changing the page title.

== Description ==

SEO Header plugin allows you to change
the heading of the page without
changing the page title.

This is especially useful if you want to use a short term for the page navigation and a long headline. For example, when using Wordpress as a standard CMS, you may set your home page to "Home" in your wordpress settings. This works out well because in the wordpress page navigation, you have a link to your home page titled “Home”.

But the problem is, that the word "Home" in your headline, does not help your SEO nor does it give the reader a great message.

With this plugin, you can use Wordpress' built in meta capabilities to build a custom headline for the page.

1. Simply add a custom field using **SEO_heading** in the "Name" field.
2. Add your custom headline to the "value" field
